                Schemes for Farmer
                The Government of India provides various schemes for farmers, but due to lack
                of awareness and miscommunication, farmers do not avail these benefits. Hence,
                we try to integrate some of the schemes like Fasal Bima Yojna and Bidding of
                Crops scheme.
                We are implementing a system which is automated and helps to reduce the
                burden on farmers as well as the system. We are providing an online means to
                apply and claim insurance which will help the system to work efficiently and
                enhance smooth handling of records.
                The bidding module will enable the farmer to place crops for auction and receive
                best price from auction which stabilizes the farmerâ€™s income as well as eliminates
                the stress of physical sale of crops in the market. We have implemented two
                modules which will help the farmer to make use of technology and reduce the
                efforts for selling the crops.
