                    Awareness on Government <br><br>Schemes</h1> <br>
                The Government of India provides various schemes for farmers, but due to lack
                of awareness and miscommunication, farmers do not avail these benefits. Hence,
                we try to integrate some of the schemes like Fasal Bima Yojna and Bidding of
                Crops scheme.<br><br>
                We are implementing a system which is automated and helps to reduce the
                burden on farmers as well as the system. We are providing an online means to
                apply and claim insurance which will help the system to work efficiently and
                enhance smooth handling of records.<br><br>
                The bidding module will enable the farmer to place crops for auction and receive
                best price from auction which stabilizes the farmerâ€™s income as well as eliminates
                the stress of physical sale of crops in the market. We have implemented two
                modules which will help the farmer to make use of technology and reduce the
                efforts for selling the crops. <br> <br>

                To provide insurance coverage and financial support to the farmers in the
          event of failure of any of the notified crop because of natural calamities,
           pests & diseases.<br>
              To stabilize the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming.<br><br>
               There will be a uniform premium of only 2% to be paid by farmers for all
Kharif crops and 1.5% for all Rabi crops. In case of annual commercial and
horticultural crops, the premium to be paid by farmers will be only 5%. 
<br><br>
The
premium rates to be paid by farmers are very low and balance premium will
be paid by the Government to provide full insured amount to the farmers
against crop loss on account of natural calamities.
